## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Held our first meeting with the project sponsor.  
   - Learned that our sponsor is now Brian Kavanaugh from the Department of Defense (DoD).  
   - Completed the project proposal, despite uncertainties about its validity due to limited interaction with the new sponsor.  
   - Received an email contact from Nibir Dhar to gather additional project requirements.  

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   - Reach out to the new sponsor (Brian Kavanaugh) to establish communication and clarify project requirements.  
   - Contact the email provided by Nibir Dhar for additional project details.  
   - Prepare to adjust the project proposal based on feedback from the new sponsor.  

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - Delay in DoD signing documents is preventing direct communication with the new sponsor.  
   - Concern that most of the current project proposal may need to be revised due to lack of input from the new sponsor.
