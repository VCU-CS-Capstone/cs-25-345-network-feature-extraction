   - Review research papers that cite our IoT dataset
   - Download dataset and understand exactly what it provides and how we can use it

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - Advisor has informed us that Project requirements may still change once new sponsor joins, but advisor wants us to work on IoT idea until it does, and if we don't get new requirements/project within the next week, we should write project proposal following IoT idea.
