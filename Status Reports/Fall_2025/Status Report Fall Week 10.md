## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Discussed model optimization and compute challenges with the sponsors.  
   - Reviewed recommendations to reduce feature usage and improve model efficiency, including k-fold cross-validation and feature importance analysis using XGBoost or CatBoost.  
   - Learned about the use of singularity containers for future containerization requirements.  
   - Received details about the in-person presentation scheduled for April in Northern Virginia.  

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   - Contact VCU to explore borrowing additional compute resources for model training.  
   - Work on preprocessing the dataset and splitting the data for lightweight model development.  
   - Explore feature reduction using XGBoost or CatBoost for improved model performance.  
   - Begin initial implementation of a lightweight model.  
   - Complete and submit the project proposal and poster.  

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - Compute intensity of the model training process remains a core concern.  
   - Potential need to cut scope if compute resources are insufficient.  
   - Containerization, CLI features, and the user manual may need to be deprioritized if performance and accuracy targets are not met early.
