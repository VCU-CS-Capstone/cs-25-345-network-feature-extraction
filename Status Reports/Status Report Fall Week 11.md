## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Gained access to VCU's high-performance computing (HPC) cluster to address compute limitations.  
   - Reviewed the preprocessing and model training pipeline with the sponsors.  
   - Received guidance on running the preprocessing and model scripts using Ubuntu or WSL environments.  

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   - Ensure all team members gain access to the HPC cluster.  
   - Verify that the workload can run without issues on the HPC cluster.  
   - Run the model on the HPC cluster to ensure functionality and address any errors.  
   - Set up and test the preprocessing workflow, including running the label-pulling script.  

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - Potential overfitting when training the model on the provided Friday dataset.  
   - Ensuring consistent configurations across team members for reproducibility.  
   - Keeping track of RAM-intensive operations during preprocessing and training.
