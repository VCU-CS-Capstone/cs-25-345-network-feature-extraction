Project: **Network Feature Extraction**

Project Description: **Develop an automated system for extracting and categorizing network data from PCAP files using AI and machine learning techniques. The system should rapidly detect, collect, classify, identify/associate with specific systems, and localize sources for use in military operations prediction. This project will involve creating a data science approach to PCAP data processing and selecting appropriate tools to address the problem at hand.**

Problem Definition:** **

Deliverables:

1. Enhanced Machine Learning Model:
   - Trained model capable of detecting specific OS minor versions and builds using the new dataset provided by the 
sponsor.
   - Implementation of k-fold cross-validation to improve model robustness.
   - Extensive hyperparameter tuning, including exploration of boost types, max_depth, gamma, learning rate, eta, and 
others.

2. Unified Command-Line Interface (CLI) Application:
   - A cohesive CLI that integrates all scripts into a user-friendly application.
   - Improved usability with clear documentation and help messages.
   - Error handling, logging, and configuration management features.

3. Containerized Application:
   - A Docker container of the OsirisML application for easy deployment across various operating systems, not limited to 
Debian Linux.
   - Dockerfile and instructions for building and running the containerized application.
